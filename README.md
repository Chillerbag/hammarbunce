practice game for OOP principles.
I was feeling like i was losing my grasp on OOP principles. So i did this project on the weekend of 01-02-2025 to dust them off. 
- the main concepts I was working on were:
- Observer pattern
- Factory pattern
- State machine pattern
- Interfaces and abstracts (for polymorphism exercises)

Anyway, I'll paste the itchio link once it is done.
